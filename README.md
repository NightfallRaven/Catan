Catan 0.5 is the latest version.  The turn sequence works and players are given resources for settlements after each dice roll.  The players must click the build settlement button to place one.  They do not have to pay yet because it is better for testing, but the restriction is there(just commented out for now).  The tile numbers are also on the board.  Yellow is grain, white is wool, brown is lumber, dark grey is ore, sandish color is desert, and red is brick.
